# Additional analyses
Code in this directory was used to perform following additional analysis:

- Code and reference files in the `enhancer_synergy` directory were used to produce the analysis for
the section 'Super-additive functions of distal enhancers,' including Fig. 6 and Extended Data Fig. 
9
- The functions in `chromatin_categorization.R` were used to define and annotate element-gene pairs
with chromatin categories
- `promoter_class_analysis.R` was used to produce the analysis for Note S5, including Fig. S5.1
- Code in `3d_contact_analyses` was used to perform analyses related to 3D contact shown in Fig. 5
and S2.1
- `extended_data_fig6_eg_properties` contains code used to compute properties across different E-G
predictors shown in Extended Data Figure 6
- `fig3_eg_properties` contains scripts to create plots for Figure 3 panels.
